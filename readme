This is a simple program written in Python to add products to a MySQL database.
It can add to 3 columns of your database: upc, name, and price.
To use this program you must create a file named usrinfo.txt in the same folder as the main.py file and use the following format:
    yourhostaddressgoeshere
    yourusernamegoeshere
    yourpasswordgoeshere
    yourdatabasenamegoeshere
Nothing more, nothing less.

Enjoy,
